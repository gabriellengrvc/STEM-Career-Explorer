      <h1>Computer Science?</h1>

      <p class="paragraph">Computer Science is the study of computers and computing. The field includes a wide scope of different subjects, ranging from topics such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, to others like bioinformatics and data analysis. An important part of computer science is understanding algorithms, which are sets of detailed instructions on how to solve problems or perform certain functions. In addition to understanding algorithms, computer scientists also work to develop different programs and software to solve real-life problems. 
Computer science is an ever changing field, and is constantly at the cutting edge of modern technological advancement.
