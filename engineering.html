      <h3>What is</h3>
      <h1>Engineering?</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">Engineering combines the fields of science and mathematics to solve real world problems that improve the world around us. Engineers are problem solvers, organizers, communicators, calculators and designers. They are capable of clearly defining a problem and its relevant constraints and providing a simple solution. Engineering is a broad discipline that is often broken down into several sub-disciplines such as chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, bioengineering, aerospace engineering, and more.</p>

    <h2>HELEN BLANCHARD</h2>
    <p class="columnp">Helen was one of the great inventors of the early industrial era. Her most famous creation was the zigzag sewing machine, patented in 1873, which revolutionized garment durability by sealing seam edges. This invention is now part of the Smithsonian Museum of American History collection. Helen was reknowned for her inventions in sewing technology.

    <h2>EDITH CLARKE</h2>
    <p class="columnp">Edith was the first female electrical engineer to be employed in the United States. She invented the Clarke calculator, a device could solve line equations involving hyperbolic functions ten times faster than previous methods. In 1947, she made history again as the first female professor of electrical engineering in America at UT Austin.
